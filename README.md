# legimi-go

Simple, alternative downloader of [Legimi](https://www.legimi.pl/) ebooks written in Go.

Basically, a rewrite of [previous downloader in Lua](https://github.com/tp86/legimi/).

It is completely unofficial, I am not affiliated with Legimi in any way.

> [!NOTE]
> This is still work in progress, however, it is already usable.

You can find more information about how it came about in [Background](#background).

## Installation

Simply download archive from Releases section, unpack and make it executable (if needed): `$ chmod +x legimi-go`.
You can add installation directory to your `PATH` variable to be able to run it from anywhere, of course.

Alternatively, if you have Go installed, you can install it using `go install` command:

```shell
$ go install github.com/tp86/legimi-go@<version>
```

`<version>` can be specific version tag from releases or `latest` to get code from `main` branch.
Note that `main` branch may contain unfinished features.
I'm doing my best to commit only working code, though.

## Usage

To view usage, invoke:
```shell
$ legimi-go --help
```

### Options

All command line switches are optional.

-   `--config path`

    Path to configuration file. Default value is `"$HOME/.config/legimi-go/config.ini"`.
    Configuration file contains your credentials and Kindle Id as assigned by Legimi service.
    It will be automatically created (with missing directories) on first command run, so generally you don't need to modify it by hand.
    If you don't want to store your login and password in file, you can provide credentials in command line (see `--login` and `--password` switches).

> [!TIP]
> You can create many configuration files so you can easily switch between multiple accounts.

-   `--login login`

    Your Legimi login.
    If you don't provide login from command line, it will be read from configuration file.
    If it is missing in configuration file as well, you will be asked to provide it during command execution.
    It will be then stored in configuration file (after successful login), so you don't have to repeat it during future command runs.
    If you do provide login from command line, it will not be written to configuration file.

-   `--password password`

    Your Legimi password.
    Same logic as for login applies.
    Note that login and password are stored in configuration file as plain text (file is readable only by its owner).
    Password that can't be stored in configuration file unchanged (e.g. surrounded by quotes) is not saved - provide it with this switch instead.

-   `--debug`

    Enable debugging mode.
    In debugging mode, selected information about exchanged requests and responses is printed to stderr.
    Currently, probably the most useful information is contained within session response.

> [!NOTE]
> You can give switches with one (`-config`) or two dashes (`--config`).

### Commands

Available commands are:

-   `list`

    List books currently on your Legimi shelf.
    Books downloaded with legimi-go are marked with date of last download.
    Number of downloads left in subscription period is shown below the list.

-   `download <id> ...`

    Download book(s) given their id(s). Book id can be obtained by listing books (first value in book entry line).
    Note that Legimi removes book from the list (but not from your shelf on Legimi website) once its download is requested,
    even if download fails. Metadata of listed books and downloads made with legimi-go are remembered in `config-books.json`
    file next to configuration file, so such book is still shown by `list` and `select` commands (marked as hidden by Legimi)
    and can be downloaded again.
    Book file is downloaded to `<id>.mobi.part` and renamed to `<id>.mobi` only when it's complete and verified.

-   `select`

    Select book(s) to download from interactive list, without typing their ids.
    Books not downloaded yet are shown first. Type to filter by author or title (case and Polish diacritics are ignored),
    move with arrow keys (also Page Up/Down, Home, End), select books with Space, press Enter to download selected books
    (or the book under cursor if none is selected) and confirm with `y`. Press Esc to quit without downloading.

-   `refresh`

    Register Kindle again (using Kindle Serial Number stored in configuration file, asked for if missing).
    Legimi hides book from the list for a device once its download is requested; registering device again resets this,
    so all books on your shelf are listed again. Kindle id stays the same for the same serial number.
    `list` command tells when there are books hidden by Legimi.

-   `version`

    Print legimi-go version.

Providing command is mandatory, there is no default command.

On the first command invocation, you will be prompted to provide credentials (if not given via command line switches, see [above](#options))
and Kindle Serial Number (Settings -> Device Options -> Device Info in Kindle).
Legimi Kindle Id will be automatically queried and stored in configuration file for future use.

### Basic usage scenario

1.  List books on your shelf

    ```shell
    $ legimi-go list
    ```

    If you're running script for the first time, or passing configuration file that does not have credentials yet, you will be prompted for login and password.

2.  Download selected book(s)

    ```shell
    $ legimi-go download <book-id>
    ```

    Downloaded book will be saved to `<book-id>.mobi` file in current working directory.

> [!TIP]
> You can `cd` into mounted Kindle's `documents` directory before downloading to avoid copying files.

3.  Copy files to your Kindle's `documents` directory

    This is optional if you have downloaded books while in `documents` directory.

## Limitations

Obviously, only subset of functionality of official Legimi app is supported.

Most error responses are not recognized / handled yet. This should improve in the future.

Script is not intended to create account or register device unknown to the Legimi service. You should use official app for this.
Device registration works, but may cause issues.

Number of book downloads left in subscription period is shown at the end of `list` command output.
If you are trying to download more books than you limit, Legimi service will block downloads.

## Troubleshooting

If something is not working as expected, try to use `-debug` switch to get more information.

Official Legimi app should be checked also, as it is a reference point. Using official app can also potentially fix issues (https://github.com/tp86/legimi-go/issues/3#issuecomment-2159820160).

## Background

Official Legimi app does not support Linux.
I wanted to be able to download ebooks from Linux without the need to switch between OSes (or even have Windows installed).

[First version](https://github.com/tp86/legimi/) of downloader was created in Lua.
It worked fine, but proved to be hard to install sometimes (dependencies installed to different paths).
It is also hard to maintain and it causes issues with Legimi protocol updates.
Therefore, I decided to rewrite script in Go. I hope it will be easier to install, use and maintain.

I extracted the logic of downloading books based on traffic exchanged between official Legimi application and service.
As such, there are certainly missing pieces and features. Also, most error responses are not supported.
See [Limitations](#limitations) for more missing features.

## TODO

- [ ] handle more error responses from Legimi service
- [ ] refactors
- [ ] documentation update
- [ ] increase test coverage
- [ ] reuse session id if possible
- [ ] parallel downloader
- [x] handle occassional EOF while getting list of books
- [ ] option to specify directory for downloaded books
